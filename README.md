## Introduction

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help developers understand and track their progress towards unlocking various GitHub achievements and badges. While GitHub does not provide a public API for achievements, this tool offers a simulated environment to explore the types of achievements available and track personal progress based on defined criteria. It encourages legitimate contributions and activities on GitHub, fostering a deeper engagement with the platform's features.

## Features

- **List Achievements:** Display a comprehensive list of known GitHub achievements and their requirements.
- **Simulated Achievement Check:** Simulate checking achievements for a given GitHub username (based on predefined logic).
- **Achievement Tracker Template:** Generate a Markdown template to manually track achievement progress.
- **Professional Structure:** Organized codebase with clear separation of concerns (src/, tests/, docs/, config/, public/).
- **Unit Tests:** Ensures code reliability and functionality.

## Screenshots

## Architecture

The `github-achievement-unlocker` is structured as a Node.js CLI application. Its architecture is designed for modularity and ease of maintenance:

**Components:**

- **CLI Application (src/index.js):** The core of the tool, handling command parsing and execution using `commander.js`.
- **Logger (src/logger.js):** Centralized logging utility using `winston` for consistent output and error handling.
- **Configuration (config/default.json):** Stores application settings, such as GitHub API endpoints and application metadata.
- **GitHub API (Simulated):** Currently, achievement checking is simulated due to the lack of a public GitHub API for achievements. This section is designed for future integration if an API becomes available.
- **Markdown Templates:** Used for generating achievement tracking templates.

## Installation

## Running Tests

To run the test suite and verify functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
