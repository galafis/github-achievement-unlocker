## Introduction

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help developers understand and track their progress towards unlocking various GitHub achievements and badges. While GitHub does not provide a public API for achievements, this tool offers a simulated environment to explore the types of achievements available and track personal progress based on defined criteria. It encourages legitimate contributions and activities on GitHub, fostering a deeper engagement with the platform's features.

## Features

- **List Achievements:** Display a comprehensive list of known GitHub achievements and their requirements.
- **Simulated Achievement Check:** Simulate checking achievements for a given GitHub username (based on predefined logic).
- **Achievement Tracker Template:** Generate a Markdown template to manually track achievement progress.
- **Professional Structure:** Organized codebase with clear separation of concerns (src/, tests/, docs/, config/, public/).
- **Unit Tests:** Ensures code reliability and functionality.

## Architecture

The `github-achievement-unlocker` is structured as a Node.js CLI application. Its architecture is designed for modularity and ease of maintenance:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Executes CLI commands| B(CLI Application)
    B -->|Uses| C{Commander.js}
    B -->|Logs output| D(Winston Logger)
    B -->|Reads configuration| E[config/default.json]
    B -->|Interacts with (simulated)| F[GitHub API (Future/Simulated)]
    B -->|Generates| G[Markdown Templates]
    C -->|Defines commands| B
    D -->|Outputs to| H[Console]
    E -->|Provides app settings| B
    F -->|Provides achievement data| B
    G -->|Displayed to| A
```

**Components:**

- **CLI Application (src/index.js):** The core of the tool, handling command parsing and execution using `commander.js`.
- **Logger (src/logger.js):** Centralized logging utility using `winston` for consistent output and error handling.
- **Configuration (config/default.json):** Stores application settings, such as GitHub API endpoints and application metadata.
- **GitHub API (Simulated):** Currently, achievement checking is simulated due to the lack of a public GitHub API for achievements. This section is designed for future integration if an API becomes available.
- **Markdown Templates:** Used for generating achievement tracking templates.
